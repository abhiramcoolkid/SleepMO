                    <p> - Make sure to turn your phone to night shift mode so that you can limit the amount of blue light emissions that come to your eyes. </p>
                    <p> - Make sure to not look at screens for at least 15-30 minutes before you sleep. </p>
                    <p> - Implement a sleeping habit, such as journaling, so that you don't look at your phone right before you sleep. </p>
                    <h2> 2. Caffeine </h2>
                    <p> - Make sure to drink caffeine before 2pm. Here's the context: Caffeine is very alike to a molecule called adenosine. When taking caffeine, the molecules can replace the receptors that are meant for adenosine. This can affect the process as you can feel awake during the night, affecting your ability to sleep. </p>
                    <p> - Only consume a moderate amount of caffeine. Take about 50-100 mg of caffeine for adequate production and normalized sleep. </p>
